# **Project Architecture: MVC with Repositories and Dependency Injection**

This project is built using a modular architecture combining **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**, **Repositories** for data abstraction, and **Dependency Injection (DI)** for managing dependencies. This ensures scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

## **Project Structure**
```plaintext
/myapp
  /app
    /controllers            # Handle user requests and responses.
    /models                 # Represent data entities.
    /repositories           # Abstract data access logic.
    /services               # Contain core business logic.
    /views                  # Handle the presentation layer (HTML, JSON, etc.).

  /config                   # Global configuration files (database, APIs, etc.).
  /di                       # Dependency Injection setup.

  /tests                    # Unit and integration tests.

  app.py                    # Application entry point.
```

## **Project Descriptions**

1. /app

   Contains the core components of the application:
   - /controllers:
      Handle user input (e.g., API routes, HTTP requests) and delegate tasks to Services.
      Example: UserController, OrderController.
   
   - /models:
      Define the application's data entities.
      Example: User, Product, Order.
   
   - /repositories:
      Encapsulate database operations and abstract the data access layer.
      Example: UserRepository, ProductRepository.
   
   - /services:
      Contain the business logic, coordinating operations across models, repositories, and external systems.
      Example: OrderService to handle order processing.
   
   - /views:
      Format and present data to users (HTML templates, JSON responses, etc.).

2. /config

   Holds global configuration files, such as:
   - Database connection settings.
   - API keys and environment-specific configurations.
3. /di

   Handles Dependency Injection setup.
   Defines how controllers, services, and repositories are connected.

4. /tests

   Contains test files to ensure application reliability:
   - Unit Tests: Validate individual components, like models or services.
   - Integration Tests: Test the interactions between components.

5. app.py

   The main entry point of the application:
   - Initializes the server, routes, dependency injection, and other setup logic.

## **Layer Interaction**

1. Controller (/controllers):

   Receives user input and sends tasks to Services.
2. Service (/services):

   Handles business logic and interacts with Repositories.
3. Repository (/repositories):

   Manages data access (e.g., database queries) and returns Models.
4. Model (/models):

   Represents structured data, fetched from or saved to the database.
5. View (/views):

   Formats data for presentation (e.g., HTML templates, JSON responses).

## **Advantages of This Architecture**

1. Separation of Concerns:

   Each layer focuses on a specific responsibility, improving maintainability.
2. Scalability:

   Adding features is straightforward without disrupting existing functionality.
3. Reusability:

   Components like services and repositories can be reused across different parts of the application.
4. Testability:

   Well-defined boundaries make unit and integration testing easier.
