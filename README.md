# Architecture with MVC, Repositories, and Dependency Injection Template

A template for organizing software projects using **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) pattern along with **Repositories** and **Dependency Injection**. This structure helps in organizing code into clear layers, improving maintainability, scalability, and testability.

## **Introduction**

This template follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture combined with **Repositories** for data access and **Dependency Injection (DI)** to manage dependencies across different components. 

- **Model**: Represents the data and the business logic.
- **View**: Represents the user interface (UI).
- **Controller**: Handles user input, interacts with models, and updates the view.

Repositories abstract the data access logic, and Dependency Injection helps in decoupling classes by injecting dependencies at runtime, rather than creating them inside classes.

This structure provides a clean architecture for managing complex applications and supports best practices for scalable and maintainable code.

## **Principles of MVC with Dependency Injection**

1. **Separation of Concerns**: MVC divides the application into three main components to isolate different responsibilities.
2. **Loose Coupling**: DI is used to inject dependencies, making classes more modular and reducing tight coupling.
3. **Testability**: Each component is independently testable, and external services can be mocked.
4. **Flexibility**: By using DI, the implementation of dependencies can be swapped easily without changing the consuming classes.
5. **Scalability**: Layers and components can evolve independently, facilitating the addition of new features without disrupting the whole system.

## **Project Structure**
```
/myapp
  /app
    /controllers            # Controllers: Handles user input, interacts with services
    /models                 # Models: Represents data entities
    /repositories           # Repositories: Abstracts data access operations
    /views                  # Views: Presentation layer (HTML, templates)
    /services               # Services: Contains business logic

  /infrastructure           # Infrastructure Layer: Deals with external systems/services
    /services               # External services like email, payment APIs, etc.
    /config                 # Configuration files for external systems

  /tests                    # Test Layer: Contains tests for different parts of the app
    /controllers            # Unit tests for controllers
    /models                 # Unit tests for models
    /repositories           # Unit tests for repositories
    /services               # Unit tests for services
    /integration            # Integration tests (testing interaction between components)

  config.py                # Global configurations (database, API keys, etc.)
  app.py                   # Application entry point
  di_container.py          # Dependency Injection Container to manage dependencies
```

## **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mvc-repositories-di-template.git
   cd mvc-repositories-di-template
   ```
2. Set up your project dependencies and tools according to your framework or technology stack (e.g., .NET Core, Spring Boot, etc.).

3. Implementing features:

- Define entities and use cases in the Business Logic Layer.
- Implement services and repositories for data access in the Data Access Layer.
- Create views, controllers, and models for the Presentation Layer.
- Define external services and configurations in the Infrastructure Layer.
- Write unit and integration tests for each layer in the Testing Layer.
- Set up Dependency Injection in the /config folder for injecting services, repositories, and other dependencies into controllers and services.

## **Why Use This Architecture?**

- Maintainability: Changes in one layer have minimal impact on others, making it easier to maintain the codebase.
- Scalability: The system can evolve with new features added to specific layers without disrupting the whole application.
- Testability: Isolated layers allow focused testing of individual components, making it easier to identify issues.
- Flexibility: Switching frameworks, databases, or technologies is easier since dependencies are managed through well-defined interfaces and Dependency Injection.
- Decoupling: Using Repositories and DI reduces tight coupling between components, leading to more modular and flexible code.
